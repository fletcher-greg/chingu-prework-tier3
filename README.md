# Chingu pre-work (Voyage 11) Tier 3

This is my Journal Web App for Chingu Tier 3.

The live site can be found here [https://silly-fermat-fbcd05.netlify.com/](https://silly-fermat-fbcd05.netlify.com/)

### Features

1.  Site has both a backend and front end
2.  Responsive Design (works on all screen sizes)
3.  User Authentication
4.  Real Time Database via **Google Firebase**

The App allows users to sign up/login and start creating notes. All their data is protected via **authentication** with Google Firebase.

Users can **add** and/or **delete** as many notes as they wish. All the notes are stored in a database hosted by **Google Firbebase.**

The **database** is real time, meaning that as soon as the user **creates** or **deletes** a note, the database instantly updates.

### Technologies

- The front-end was built with **React**.

- The backend _database_ and _authentication_ was built with **Google Firebase**

- The design was inspired by Google's **Material Design** philosphy.
